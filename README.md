"A simple online Texas Hold'em poker game has been implemented. 

First, the complete functionality of the game was implemented, including the creation of a `Card` class to support the storage of card types and provide interfaces for shuffling and dealing cards. A `Player` class was created to store player IDs, hand cards, and provide interfaces for dealing cards. Additionally, a `Game` class was developed to provide rule adjudication and other game-related functions.

Both the server-side and client-side programs were completed. The server continuously listens to a port and overrides the `run` method to connect to clients and initiate corresponding subprocesses, running the game functions in these subprocesses to handle information from two different clients.

The client uses the `BorderLayout` method to create a graphical interface, which includes customizable features such as adjustable font size, layout, and color. Information can be sent through the `appendToChatArea` function. 

Both the client and server create and read/write files to save the game progress, with exception handling functionality. Users can load the game by inputting `r`, which reads the previously generated files (with exception handling) and allows them to review the game replay. 

Additionally, the game includes features such as raising and folding, with a user-friendly graphical interface that allows users to adjust settings themselves."
